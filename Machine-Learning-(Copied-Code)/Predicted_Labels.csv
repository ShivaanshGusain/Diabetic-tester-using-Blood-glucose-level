Q Type your question
decay products of the neutron.
Therefore, considering the decay of a
neutron as a two-body decay process, it
was predicted theoretically that the kinetic energy of the electron should be a constant. But experimentally, it was observed that the electron kinetic
energy has a continuous spectrum. Considering a three-body decay
process, i.e. \( \boldsymbol{n} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{p}+\boldsymbol{e}^{-}+\overline{\boldsymbol{v}}_{e}, \) around
1930, Pauli explained the observed
electron energy spectrum. Assuming
the anti-neutrino \( \left(\bar{v}_{e}\right) \) to be massless
and possessing negligible energy, and
the neutron to be at rest, momentum
and energy conservation principles are
applied. From this calculation, the maximum kinetic energy of the electron
is \( 0.8 \times 10^{6} e V . \) The kinetic energy
carried by the proton is only the recoil
energy. What is the maximum energy of the
anti-neutrino?
A. Zero
B. Much less than \( 0.8 \times 10^{6} e V \).
C . Nearly \( 0.8 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{eV} \)

\( \frac{n_{2}}{n}, \) it is understood that the refracted
\( \boldsymbol{n}_{\mathbf{1}} \)
ray bends towards the normal. But it
never emerges on the same side of the
normal as the incident ray. According to
electromagnetism, the refractive index
of the medium is given by the relation, \( \boldsymbol{n}=\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{c}}{\boldsymbol{v}}\right)=\pm \sqrt{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\boldsymbol{r}} \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\boldsymbol{r}}}, \) where \( \boldsymbol{c} \) is the
speed of electromagnetic waves in
vacuum, \( \boldsymbol{v} \) its speed in the medium, \( \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\boldsymbol{r}} \)
and \( \mu_{r} \) are the relative permittivity and
permeability of the medium respectively. In normal materials, both
\( \epsilon_{r} \) and \( \mu_{r} \) are positive, implying positive
\( n \) for the medium. When both \( \epsilon_{r} \) and \( \mu_{r} \)
are negative, one must choose the
negative root of \( n . \) Such negative
refractive index materials can now be
artificially prepared and are called
meta-materials. They exhibit significantly different optical behavior, without violating any physical laws.
since \( n \) is negative, it results in a
change in the direction of propagation
of the refracted light. However, similar
