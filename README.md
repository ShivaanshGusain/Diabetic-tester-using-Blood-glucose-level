Machine Learning methods of classification

This repository contains practical implementations of various classification techniques in machine learning using Python and scikit-learn. Each example is simple, beginner-friendly, and focuses on **one type of classification problem** with **realistic datasets**.

Repository structure - 

1. Binary Classification
  Contains the working of how binary classification works in a model; finding out the accuracy score as well as testing it by user-input.

  Algorithm - Logistic Regression
  Example - Blood-glucose level Vs Diabetic (0/1) 
  Input - Numeric data
  Output - 0 ( false ) , 1 ( true ) 

2. Multiple Classification 
  Contains the working of how multiple classificication works with a model.

  Algorithms used - Logistic Regression , Multinomial algorithm
  Example - Flipper's-length Vs Species classification
  Input - Numeric data
  Output - 0/1/2
